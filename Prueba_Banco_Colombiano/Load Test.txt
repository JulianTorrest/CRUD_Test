To load test the NodeJS API code with a PostgreSQL database, you can use various tools that simulate multiple concurrent users making requests to the API server. Here are some of the popular load testing tools that you can use:

Apache JMeter: Apache JMeter is a popular open-source load testing tool that allows you to simulate HTTP requests and measure the performance of web applications. With JMeter, you can create a test plan that includes various HTTP requests and set the number of threads and iterations to simulate concurrent users.

LoadRunner: LoadRunner is a commercial load testing tool from Micro Focus that allows you to simulate thousands of concurrent users and measure the performance of web applications. LoadRunner supports multiple protocols including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, and others.

Gatling: Gatling is an open-source load testing tool that allows you to simulate HTTP requests and measure the performance of web applications. Gatling uses a Scala-based DSL to define the load testing scenarios and provides real-time metrics and graphs to analyze the test results.

Artillery: Artillery is an open-source load testing tool that allows you to simulate HTTP requests and measure the performance of web applications. Artillery supports multiple protocols including HTTP, WebSocket, and MQTT, and allows you to define the load testing scenarios using YAML files.

Once you have selected a load testing tool, you can configure it to simulate multiple concurrent users making requests to the NodeJS API server. You can set the number of users, the duration of the test, and the type of requests to be made to the server. You can then run the load test and analyze the test results to identify any performance bottlenecks or issues with the API server or database.
